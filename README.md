# MCCS
MCCS (Minecraft Command Script) is a programming language designed to make <a href="https://minecraft.net">Minecraft</a> <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Data_pack">datapack</a> development easier.


## This Repo
This Repo just contains the source code for the MCCS compiler.
Currently, there is not any public documentation on the language syntax.
This Repo is in it's early stages and will be refined.

## Using
The source code is written in Rust.
If you have `git` and `rustup` installed, you can use these commands to compile and run the code:<p>
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/MasonFeurer/MCCS.git"
cd MCCS
cargo run
```

If you are using a Unix-like operating system, you should already have `git` installed.<p>
For more on installing `git`, see https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git.<p>
For more on installing `rustup`, see https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.<p>
